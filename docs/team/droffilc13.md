### Project: TA<sup>2</sup>

TA2 is a desktop application that offers Teaching Assistants (TA) from the School of Computing (SoC) at the National University of Singapore (NUS) a convenient and efficient way to manage student information and keep track of students' assignment submissions.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Redesign the whole interface to accommodate assignments in TA<sup>2</sup>. ([\#46](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/46))
  * What it does: Added the assignment list panel to view students' assignments. Design the assignment card. Wrote the backend code for the `Assignmenmt` class and most of its components.
  * Justification: This feature is the main feature that differentiates TA<sup>2</sup> from AB3 which this project is based on. It forms the foundation for future commands that manipulate assignments.
  * Highlights: This enhancement forms the bedrock of what TA<sup>2</sup> is. Any future commands added will need assignments and assignment list panel to perform their operations. This implementation is challenging because it requires research and trial and error to design front end using JavaFx.  Also, the analysis of how backend code interacts with frontend is necessary to understand how they are linked.

* **New Feature**: Improve `give`, `remove` and `mark` assignments input format to make it less cumbersome. ([\#118](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/118))
  * What it does: Change from `NAME` to `INDEX` to reference the student to `give` assignments to. For `remove` and `mark`, change from `NAME` to reference just the person whose assignment is currently displayed.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it is faster, less cumbersome and less error-prone  to type the `INDEX` of student/assignments compared to the `NAME` of the student.
  * Highlights: This change is challenging because there is a need to understand how the commands work previously to be able to  change accordingly.

* **New Feature**: Improve undo and redo to be able to change the state of `list` and `find`. ([\#118](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/118))
  * What it does: Undo and redo could only occur if the person/assignment state has changed. By storing the state of the filtered person list, `list` and `find` can also be included as well.
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience because it makes sense that undo and redo should be able to return the previous action. Excluding `list` and `find` may make the product unintuitive.
  * Highlights: This change needs an analysis of how undo and redo works and how state is tracked.

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases [`v1.2`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/releases/tag/untagged-201b35d412632ea069df), [`v1.3.trial`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.3.trial), [`v1.3(final)`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.3(final)), [`v1.4(final)`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.4) (4 releases) on GitHub. 
  * Maintaining the issue tracker and ensure internal deadlines are met.
