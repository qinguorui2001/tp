### Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />
</p>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#Common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />
</p>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />
</p>

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Assignment` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>
</p>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>
</p>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
</p>

The `Model` component,

* stores the versioned address book data which includes
  * all `Person` objects contained in a `UniquePersonList` object
  * all `Assignment` objects of the "active" `Person` object contained in a `UniqueAssignmentList` object
  * the "active" `Person` (the person whose assignments are stored in `UniqueAssignmentList` of `AddressBook`)
  * the current predicate of the filtered person list
  * the states of `ReadOnlyAddressBook`
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Assignment` objects of the "active" `Person` object as a separate _observable_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Assignment>` that can be 'observed' as well.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />
</p>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Assignment list panel display feature

#### Implementation

The assignment list panel display mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`, where the specified person's assignment list is stored internally under `assignments` This `assignments` is retrieved or updated by the following methods:
* `AddressBook#getAssignmentList()`
* `AddressBook#updateAssignmentList(Person person)`  —  where `person` is the specified person.

These methods are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getAssignmentList()` and `Model#updateAssignmentList(Person person)` respectively.
In addition, `Model` contains a field `assignmentsList` that points towards `assignment` in `AddressBook`. `assignmentsList` serve as connection for `Logic` to retrieve `assignments` to display.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the show assignment mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `assignments` will be initialized with a `UniqueAssignmentList` that does not contain any `Assignment`.

Step 2. The user inputs `show 2` command to display the 2nd person's assignment list in the address book. The `show` command will then call `Model#updateAssignmentList(person)`, whereby `person` variable is the 2nd person in the address book.
This will then call `Addressbook#updateAssignmentList(person)`, causing the `assignments` in `AddressBook` to be replaced with the assignments in 2nd person's assignment list.


The two object diagram below shows illustrates how the objects interacts and changes when a `show` command is executed.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/DisplayAssignmentObjectDiagram1.png">
<br>
<img src="images/DisplayAssignmentObjectDiagram2.png">
</p>


Step 3. When `assignments` is updated, the assignment list panel of the`Ui` will be updated accordingly since it is an observer of the `assignments` list in `Model`

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions between the `Logic` and `Model` component, when an assignment command (e.g `show`, `give`, `done`, `remove`) is called.

<p align="center">

<img src="images/DisplayAssignmentListSequenceDiagram.png">

</p>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the assignment list can be displayed:**

* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Displays assignment list next to the contact list panel in the same window.

  * Pros: Allows you to do everything on one window.

  * Cons: Commands that deal with persons and assignments need to be distinctly named as they share the same window.<br>
  e.g. `add` person and `add` assignments will have conflict.

* **Alternative 2:** Displays assignment list on a new separate window.

  * Pros: Allows you to cleanly segregate commands of assignments and persons because they are on different windows.
  
  * Cons: Additional UI may lead to slower processing and execution.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Assignment Feature

#### Implementation
The `Assignment` class encapsulates the current Assignment feature and composes of `Description`, `Status` and `DueDate` class.

It implements the operation `Assignment#isSameAssignment(Assignment assignment)` to check for duplicate assignments. Currently, assignments are similar if they have the same description and this check is case-insensitive. This is because each student is under one module and having a similarly named assignment within the same module is less likely.

Next, the current available `Status` of `Assignment` are `PENDING` and `COMPLETED`. Since the type of `Status` are fixed, the `Status` class contains an `enumeration StatusType` to store the valid values. The use of static methods `Status#createCompletedStatus()` and `Status#createPendingStatus()` initialises the `COMPLETED Status` and `PENDING Status` respectively. Meanwhile, the constructor, `Status(StatusType value)`, is set to private to prevent instantiation through inheritance.

#### Related Implementation: UniqueAssignmentList
A `UniqueAssignmentList` stores a list of `Assignment` and prevents duplicates. `Assignment` class extends `Comparable` interface for sorting purposes within a `UniqueAssignmentList`. Currently, only `AddressBook` and `Person` has a reference to `UniqueAssignmentList`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/developerguide/implementation/AssignmentClassDiagram.png">
</p>

`UniqueAssignmentList#sort()` is a method responsible for sorting the list based on the `Status` and `DueDate` of the `Assignment`. The `UniqueAssignmentList` gives more importance to assignments that are pending than completed, and if both are pending, it will break the tie by choosing the assignment with an earlier due date.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/developerguide/implementation/SortedAssignments.png">
</p>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How Status can be instantiated:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Instantiate Status using static methods with enumerations to store the fixed values
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May become harder to update if there are more types of status with different types of behaviour

* **Alternative 2:** Use a factory method to instantiate the different types of status
    * Pros: Divides cleanly all the different types of status and intended behaviour and make it very easy to add new status with few adjustments by creating another subclass.
    * Cons: The code length is very long due to all the subclasses of status and may not be optimal for Status class with very few status types.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Keeping track on person whose assignments are displayed feature

#### Implementation

The `activePerson` field is a reference to a `Person` object within `UniquePersonList`, wrapped in an `Optional`, whose `Assignment` objects are stored in `UniqueAssignmentList` within `AddressBook`. It forms the bedrock of many commands that involves `Assignment` in `UniqueAssignmentList`.

`activePerson` field is wrapped in an `Optional` because there is a possibility that there is no `activePerson`, which means that there is no `Person` object whose assignment list is currently stored in the `UniqueAssignmentList`.

The `ModelManager` has a reference to the `VersionedAddressBook` which is a subclass of `AddressBook` and has the following accessors to `activePerson`:
* `Model#hasActivePerson()` —  Checks the presence of active person.
* `Model#getActivePerson()` —  Retrieves the active person if it exists to perform operations on the person's assignment list.

Operations that may change the person whose assignments are displayed will use the above accessors before calling `Model#updateAssignmentList(Person person)` to change the target of `activePerson` to the `person` parameter, wrapped in an `Optional` if it exists in `UniquePersonList`. If not, `activePerson` will be updated to an empty `Optional` that means an absence of `activePerson`.

The `delete` command is one of the commands that may affect the assignment list displayed. Since `Person` objects and their `Assignments` share a whole-part relationship, when a `Person` object is deleted, their list of `Assignment` should be deleted as well. Hence, if a particular `Person` object is the `activePerson`, the `UniqueAssignmentList` in `AddressBook` should be cleared of `Assignment` objects belonging to that `Person` if he/she is deleted. Below is an activity diagram to illustrate this point.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UpdateAssignmentListActivityDiagram.png" alt="Update assignment list activity diagram when person is deleted">
</p>

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): use a reference to point to `person` whose assignments should be displayed**
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Ignoring the property of `UniqueAssignmentList` that prevents duplicate `Assignment` from being stored, this method will be limited to displaying a particular person's assignments. Difficult to extend to displaying `Assignment` objects of multiple `Person` objects.

* **Alternative 2:** `Person` class store an additional attribute `boolean isActivePerson`.
  * Pros: Can toggle between multiple persons.
  * Cons: `isActivePerson` may not be a suitable property of `Person` class since it may not be the responsibility of `Person` to remember whether it is the `activePerson`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commitAddressBook()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UndoRedoState0.png">
</p>

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `LogicManager` instance calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UndoRedoState1.png">
</p>

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The same `LogicManager` instance calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UndoRedoState2.png">
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UndoRedoState3.png">
</p>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png">
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UndoRedoState4.png">
</p>

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UndoRedoState5.png">
</p>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />
</p>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Give feature

#### Implementation
The `give` command allows users to add the specified assignment to a particular person is stored in the model.
Person who already has the specified assignment will not have a duplicated assignment added to him. The
command is abstracted as `AddAssignmentCommand` and extends `Command`. When the user inputs the command,
`Command#execute` is called and returns a `CommandResult`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `AddAssignmentCommand` is executed.

Step 1. The user executes `list` command to see the current list of persons.

Step 2. The user executes `give 2 d/Assignment 1 by/ 03/11/2021` command to add assignment to the second person in
the specified module. When `Command#execute` is called, the `give 2...` command will filter out persons in the currently
displayed list with `INDEX` 2 and add the specified assignment to this person if he or she exists and does
not have that assignment.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the person at the specified 
`INDEX` does not exist, it will return an error to the user.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the `give` command is executed:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/GiveSequenceDiagram.png">
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddAssignmentCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `give` command:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/GiveActivityDiagram.png" width="600" height="550" />
</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: Adds an assignment to a person in the currently displayed list or to any other person in storage:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add an assignment to a person in the currently displayed list.
    * Pros: If the displayed list is shorter, the addition of assignments will be faster.
    * Cons: User has to ensure that the desired person is displayed on the displayed contact list first before adding of assignment.

* **Alternative 2:** Add an assignment to any person in the storage.
    * Pros: Allows user to add assignment to a particular person even when he is not visible in the list.
    * Cons: Might take longer to execute.

* Considering the fact that the `give` command is meant for users to add assignments to visible persons in contact list,
* **Alternative 1** was chosen as it meets this specification. Moreover, it will not duplicate the assignment for
  persons who already have the assignment.
  **Alternative 1** requires an additional effort for user to ensure the person who the user want to give the assignment
  to is actually stored in the contact list but not displayed, which may lead to the user giving assignments to the wrong person.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Remove feature

#### Implementation
The `remove` command allows users to remove the specified assignment of a particular person in model.
It is abstracted as `DeleteAssignmentCommand` and extends `Command`. When the user inputs the command,
`Command#execute` is called and returns a `CommandResult`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `DeleteAssignmentCommand` is executed.

Step 1. The user executes `list` command to see the current list of persons.

Step 2. The user executes `remove 1` command to remove the first assignment of a person whose assignments are currently displayed. When `Command#execute`
is called, the `remove 1` command will filter out the assignment in the currently displayed assignment list with the `INDEX` 1 and remove
the assignment if there is an assignment at that `INDEX` in assignment list.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
**Note:** If currently displayed assignment list does not contain the assignment at specified `INDEX`, it will return an error to the user.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the `remove` command is executed:
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/RemoveSequenceDiagram.png">
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteAssignmentCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `remove` command:
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/RemoveActivityDiagram.png" width="600" height="550" />
</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: Deletes assignment of a person in the currently displayed list or for any person in storage:**

* **Alternative 1:** (current choice) Deletes assignment of a person in the currently displayed list.
    * Pros: Allows for a safer delete of assignments.
    * Cons: User has to ensure that the desired assignment is displayed on the displayed assignment list first before deleting that assignment.

* **Alternative 2:** Deletes the assignment of the specified person, by inputting their name with the command.
    * Pros: Allows user to delete assignment of a person without the need of additional commands.
    * Cons: User may not be certain about which person's assignment to delete if several of them have completed the assignment
    and likely to remember the wrong person name if the currently displayed contact list is not shown.

* Considering the fact that TA<sup>2</sup> is designed to be efficient in managing student submissions, **alternative 1** is
  chosen. The potential undesired deletion of assignments in **alternative 2** means the user has to manually recover the
  deleted assignment by adding the assignment again. Compared to the additional time taken to execute the `list` command
  in **alternative 1**, it may take up much more time.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Giveall feature

#### Implementation
The `giveall` command allows users to add the specified assignment to all persons in the same module. Persons who already
have the specified assignment will not have a duplicated assignment added to them. The command is abstracted as
`AddAssignmentToAllCommand` and extends `Command`. When the user inputs the command, `AddAssignmentToAllCommand#execute()` is called and returns a `CommandResult`.

When `AddAssignmentToAllCommand#execute()` is called, `AddAssignmentToAllCommand` checks if any persons in `AddressBook` has the specified
assignment already. To avoid any inconsistencies in the specified assignment and any existing assignment with the same `Description`,
`AddAssignmentToAllCommand#execute()` calls `AddAssignmentToAllCommand#getAssignmentIfExists(List<Person> personListWithAssignment)`
to check if any persons contain an assignment with the same `Description` as the specified assignment. If such an assignment
exists, a check is done to make sure that the `DueDate` field of the specified assignment and the existing assignment are
the same. Additionally, the `Description` field of the added assignment will follow that of the existing assignment to
prevent any inconsistencies in letter cases. The assignment will then be added to all persons who do not have the assignment.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If there are no persons with the specified
module field, it will return an error to the user. <br>
Additionally, if all persons in the module already have the specified assignment,
it will return an error to the user as well.

</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `AddAssignmentToAllCommand` is executed.

Step 1. The user executes `giveall m/CS2100 d/Assignment 2 by/ 03/10/2021` command to add `Assignment 2` to all persons in
the module `CS2100` for the first time. When `AddAssignmentToAllCommand#execute()` is called, `AddAssignmentToAllCommand` will filter out persons in `AddressBook`
with the module field `CS2100`. Since no persons have this assignment, it is added for all persons in `CS2100`.

Step 2. The user now decides to add another person in the module `CS2100` as this person was accidentally left out earlier.
The user executes `add Alice Koh m/CS2100 e/e2716238@u.nus.edu` to add the person in.

Step 3. The user wants to give this person the assignment he previously gave to the other persons in `CS2100`. The user
executes `giveall m/CS2100 d/assignment 2 by/ 03/10/2021`. Like Step 1, when `AddAssignmentToAllCommand#execute()` is called,
`AddAssignmentToAllCommand` will filter out persons in `AddressBook` with the module field `CS2100`. However, since
some persons in `CS2100` already have `Assignment 2`, the existing assignment will be returned when
`AddAssignmentToAllCommand#getAssignmentIfExists(List<Person> personListWithAssignment)` is called. Since the `DueDate` of
both the specified and existing assignment are `03/10/2021`, no error message will be thrown. `Assignment 2` will then be added
for all persons in `CS2100` who does not have it yet.

The following sequence diagram shows how `giveall m/CS2100 d/assignment 2 by/ 03/10/2021` is executed:

</p>

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: Adds assignment to persons in the specified module who are in the currently displayed list or
to all persons in the specified module:**

* **Alternative 1:** Adds assignment to persons in the specified module who are in the currently displayed list
  * Pros: Allows user to add assignment to a more specific group of persons
  * Cons: User has to carry out `list` command first if addition of assignments is desired for all persons

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Adds assignment to all persons in the specified module
  * Pros: Allows user to add assignment to all persons even when some persons are not displayed in the list
  * Cons: Less flexibility in terms of the choice of persons to add assignments to

* Considering the fact that the `giveall` command is meant for users to add assignments to all persons in the specified
  module, **alternative 2** was chosen as it meets this specification. Moreover, the existence of the
  `give` command which allows users to add an assignment to a specific person suggests that the `giveall` command might
  provide better utility for users if it allows for the addition of assignments to a bigger group of persons.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Clean feature

#### Implementation
The `clean` command allows users to remove all completed assignment from all persons.
It is abstracted as `CleanAssignmentCommand` and extends `Command`. When the user inputs the command,
`Command#execute` is called and returns a `CommandResult`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `CleanAssignmentCommand` is executed.

Step 1. The user executes `list` command to see the current list of persons.

Step 2. The user executes `clean` command to remove all the completed assignments.
When `Command#execute` is called, the `clean` command will get the assignment list of all persons in the model and
remove all assignments with the completed status.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `clean` command is executed:
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/CleanSequenceDiagram.png">
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `CleanAssignmentCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Step 3. The user executes `show 1` to check that all completed assignments has been removed for the first person.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `clean` command:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/CleanActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />
</p>

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: Deletes completed assignments of person with assignments currently displayed or for all persons:**

* **Alternative 1:** Deletes completed assignments of person with assignments currently displayed
  * Pros: Allows for a safer delete of assignments
  * Cons: User has to carry out `show INDEX` command for every person if deletion of assignments is desired for all persons

* **Alternative 2(current choice):** Deletes completed assignment of all persons
  * Pros: Allows user to delete assignment of all persons without the need of additional commands
  * Cons: Undesired deletion of assignment of persons not in displayed list may occur

* Considering the fact that TA<sup>2</sup> is designed to be efficient in managing student submissions, **alternative 2** is
  chosen. When the list of persons increase to considerable numbers, deletion of completed assignments will require the user
  to input an additional command for each person. Bearing in mind that users make use of the `clean` command to remove
  completed assignments that they no longer want to view, **alternative 2** does this job more efficiently. Although there
  may be completed assignments that users want to keep in the list which they accidentally delete, there is the `undo` command
  which allows the user to retrieve the desired assignments easily.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Done feature

#### Implementation
The `done` command allows users to mark the specified assignment of a particular person in model.
It is abstracted as `MarkAssignmentCommand` and extends `Command`. When the user inputs the command,
`Command#execute` is called and returns a `CommandResult`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `MarkAssignmentCommand` is executed.

Step 1. The user executes `list` command to see the current list of persons.

Step 2. The user executes `done 1` command to mark the first assignment of the currently displayed assignment list as done. When `Command#execute` is called,
the `done 1` command will filter out assignments with `INDEX` 1 and mark the specified assignment as completed
if assignment of `INDEX` 1 exists in the currently displayed assignment list.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
**Note:** If there is no assignment at that specified index, it will return an error to the user.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the `done` command is executed:
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/DoneSequenceDiagram.png">
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `MarkAssignmentCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `done` command:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/DoneActivityDiagram.png" width="600" height="550" />
</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: Marks assignment of a person in the currently displayed list as done or for any person in storage model:**

* **Alternative 1:** (current choice) Marks assignment in the currently displayed assignment list as completed.
    * Pros: Allows for a safer mark of assignments.
    * Cons: User has to ensure that the desired assignment is displayed on the displayed assignment list first before marking the assignment as completed.

* **Alternative 2:** Marks an assignment as completed of the specified person, by in putting the name with the command.
    * Pros: Allows user to mark assignment of a person without the need of additional commands.
    * Cons: User may not be certain about which person's assignment to mark if several of them has completed assignment
      and likely to remember the wrong person name if the current person displayed list is not shown.

* Considering the fact that TA<sup>2</sup> is designed to be user-friendly in managing student submissions, **alternative 1** is
  chosen. The potential undesired mark of assignments in **alternative 2** means the user has to manually recover the
  marked assignment by undoing and marking assignment again. Compared to the additional time taken to execute the `list` command
  in **alternative 1**, it may take up much more time.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find feature

#### Implementation
The `find` command allows users to find specific people in their list, based on certain
matching criteria such as:

1. Name
2. Module
3. Tags

The command is represented by the `find` keyword.

This allows users to specify their list and cut down on the amount of information displayed,
selectively choosing those that the users would only like to see.

The `find` Command is a subclass of the *Command* class. Once the user enters the `find`
keyword, the `LogicManager` class will execute the command and pass the
input to the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the given input.

From this class, a specific parser class known as the `FindPersonCommandParser`
is created and used to parse the input based on the `find` specificity.

Next, the `FindPersonCommandParser` class returns a `FindPersonCommand` or
an exception, depending on the validity of the command input. The
Command#execute is then called, returning a `CommandResult` class.

Given below is a more specific example of the command execution.

1. The user wants to find a specific person based on their name
2. The user executes `find n/alice`, causing a `FindPersonCommand` to be returned
3. The Command#execute is called, which causes the list to update and reflect those whose names matches alice

The sequence of this command execution can be visualized using the
below sequence diagram:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/FindSequenceDiagram.png">
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindPersonCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `find` command:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/FindActivityDiagram.png">
</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: Finding people based on OR criteria or AND criteria**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allows user to find people based on **OR** criteria
  * Pros: Allows for a more flexible search, making it less error-prone
  * Cons: Reduce efficiency of searching for specific people if large chunks of information
  is returned

* **Alternative 2:** Allow users to find people based on **AND** criteria
  * Pros: Users can perform more powerful searching to suit their
  requirements and criteria, thus possibly being more effective and efficient
  if the user knows who is in mind
  * Cons: Less error tolerant as one simple mistake can result in no matches
  being returned.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### [Proposed] Find Extension
**Allow finding to have both specificity and flexibility**

**Proposed Implementation**

In order to create the option for the users to select the type of find they are trying to 
execute, be it specific or flexible, such a functionality is implemented in the following way:

The proposed find extension to allow specificity and flexibility can be implemented by altering 
how the`FindCommandParser` class works. Users are required to specify an extra parameter to denote
the type of find they are trying to execute.

This extra parameter will be **-S** and **-F** to represent specific and flexible respectively. 

An example command call:
- `find -s n/Bryan m/CS1101S` to find all people named Bryan who are enrolled in CS1101S
  - Bryan Loh enrolled in module CS1101s will be listed.
  - Bryan Tan enrolled in module CS1231S will not be listed.

This can be facilitated by splitting the `FindPersonCommand` into two subtypes: `FindSpecificPersonCommand`
and `FindAllPersonCommand`.

With the separation of the commands, two new classes to test for keywords have to be created, namely the
`PersonContainsAllKeywordsPredicate` and `PersonContainsAnyKeywordPredicate`. These two classes will then
extend the `PersonContainsKeywordPredicate` class which implements the `Predicate<T>` interface, 
and then override the methods stipulated by the interface.

This way, `FindSpecificPersonCommand` instantiates the `PersonContainsAllKeywordsPredicate` class whilst
`FindAllPersonCommand` instantiates the `PersonContainsAnyKeywordPredicate` class.

Given below is the partial class diagram of how the logic behind the new find command works:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ImprovedFindDiagram.png">
</p>

The following is the activity diagram for a specific find command execution:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ImprovedSpecificFindActivityDiagram.png">
</p>

The following is the activity diagram for a flexible find command execution:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ImprovedFlexibleFindActivityDiagram.png">
</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How the different find commands can be implemented.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create subclasses to handle the different kinds of behaviour of `Find`.
  * Pros: Easy to extend classes and implement different functionalities 
  * Cons: User has to input more prefixes to specify the command

* **Alternative 2:** Have the parser identify the different find commands without extra prefixes 
  * Pros: User can use the find command as per usual without extra prefixes / inputs
  * Cons: Requires the application to recognize a lot of different user inputs which could mean 
  different kinds of find, which is unfeasible to implement considering the time given

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Friendlier Command Inputs
In striving to adopt a more user-centric approach in command recognition, additional commands are
included on top of the original commands which stuck by a strict and predefined prefix. This offered
very little flexibility to our users in an event they make a mistake.

Here are the commands that currently support a *friendly* input command:
1. `give`
2. `giveall`


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**

The `give` and `giveall` command classes will not create "`Give`" classes but instead:

The `give` command results in the creation of the `AddAssignmentCommandParser` class whilst the `giveall` command results 
in the creation of the `AddAssignmentToAllCommandParser`. 

</div>


The `give` command has the sole purpose of adding a single assignment to an individual in the list.

The `giveall` command has the sole purpose of adding a single assignment to all individuals under the same module in the list.

The following table contains the new *friendly* commands that a user may provide, instead of the
original command inputs.

| Friendly Command                            | Corresponding Command                         |   Example Usages                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| tmr                                         | sets the date to be tomorrow                  | give n/name d/description by/tmr                                        |
| today                                       | sets the date to be the current date          | give n/name d/description by/today                                      |
| week                                        | sets the date to be a week from now           | give n/name d/description by/week                                       |
| mon                                         | sets the date to be the upcoming Monday       | give n/name d/description by/mon                                        |
| tue                                         | sets the date to be the upcoming Tuesday      | give n/name d/description by/tue                                        |
| wed                                         | sets the date to be the upcoming Wednesday    | give n/name d/description by/wed                                        |
| thu                                         | sets the date to be the upcoming Thursday     | give n/name d/description by/thu                                        |
| fri                                         | sets the date to be the upcoming Friday       | give n/name d/description by/fri                                        |
| sat                                         | sets the date to be the upcoming Saturday     | give n/name d/description by/sat                                        |
| sun                                         | sets the date to be the upcoming Sunday       | give n/name d/description by/sun                                        |

When the user enters a command with the *friendly* command input, the `AddressBookParser` class will recognize the command
and parse the entered command. 

If the command the user chose is `give`, this triggers the `AddAssignmentCommandParser#parse` 
method to be called with the user input arguments. If the command chosen is `giveall`, this
triggers the `AddAssignmentToAllCommandParser#parse` method to be called instead. 


From there, each individual argument token is parsed and for the *friendly* command, it will be 
recognized within the `DueDate` class as a date with a *friendly* command format. This then calls 
the Java library `TemporalAdjusters` class to return a `LocalDate` instance that represents the 
desired *friendly* command input date. 

From here, the `AddAssignmentCommand` class is then instantiated if the user command is `give`, or
conversely, the `AddAssignmentToAllCommand` class. 

Finally, the results are then actualized by the `Model` component.

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: Rigidity in allowing users to add assignments correctly yet handle multiple short-form user inputs:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allows users to add based on format and some *friendly* commands
    * Pros: Allows for a safer addition of assignment, ensuring strict adherence to format
    * Cons: User has to memorize the command usage or get it wrong the first time to view the error message

* **Alternative 2:** Simplify the rigid commands and make all commands user-friendly
    * Pros: Users can perform more powerful addition of assignments without having to type too much or following too strict
    of a guideline
    * Cons: Requires the application to recognize a lot of different words, be it short or long form, to allow
    maximum user-friendliness, which may not be too feasible to achieve

#### [Proposed] Friendly Commands
1. `find`
